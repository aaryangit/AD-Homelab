## **Creating Users in the Active Directory**  

Here We will figure out how to create users in AD.

This is the Server Dashboard and then click on the top right corner where we can see option to "Add users and Computers"

These are the default groups on AD that you can find under "Groups" tab if you explore the right hand panel.  

After navigating to the Users sections you can find two default users.

To create new Users we can just right click anywhere in the users section and create the users we want.

We can create the users by inputting the basic details like their name and specify the domain.

I have create some basic users here.

For the sake of this lab and implement groups and policies further and just as a good general practice we will create Organizational Unit ( OU ) which we will use further down the line.

We can transfer these users to the OU's we create by just drag-n-dropping them to the selected OU.  

The Following OU's were created for testing.

In the OU "Engineering" After right clicking in the OU you can create groups as well as I created a group calledd EngineeringShare, which we'll use further in the creating shares and use GPO's on.

And these two users were added in the group.
